# Texture generation
* Each texture pack should be based off of the previously generated texture pack. This will be done by inputting each texture into stable diffusion when generating.
    * It's possible that the original MC texture will also need to be inputted so that textures don't go too off the rails
* Some textures must be made seamless. This can be done using stable diffusion or some post-processing.
